This is a simple analysis project made by me for my B.Tech 2nd Year Probability and Statistics project. It is made in R studio and there are the CSV files uploaded
along with my presentation as well.

First of all to run this code you will require a program like R-Studio or whatever you are comfortable with.

Two packages used in this program ggplot2 and moments can be downloaded from Tools -> Instal Packages and then searching the names of the libraries if you are using
R-Studio.

In the code you can either change the [your username] in setwd() to your username and putting the CSVs in Documents folder or change the location in setwd to wherever 
you are storing the CSV files.

If you want to know your username go to file manager/This PC/C:/Users and check the username.
